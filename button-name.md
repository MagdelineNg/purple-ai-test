<button class="some-class" id="some-id" aria-label="Click me"><i class="some-class">Click me</i></button>

In this updated code, the aria-label attribute has been added to provide a text alternative for the button. The text "Click me" has also been added inside the <i> tag to provide discernible text for users who may not be able to see the icon.
