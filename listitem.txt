To improve the accessibility of this code, the <li> element should be contained within a <ul> or <ol> element. Here is an updated version of the code:

<ul>
  <li class="some-class">
    <a href="/contact-us/" class="some-class">Contact Us</a>
    <div class="some-class"></div>
  </li>
</ul>

By wrapping the <li> element in a <ul> element, we ensure that the list item is part of a list, which makes it easier for screen readers to navigate and understand the content.
