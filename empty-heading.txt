<h1 class="some-class">Title</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b class="some-class">Subtitle 1</b></li>
  <li><b class="some-class">Subtitle 2</b></li>
</ul> 

By adding meaningful headings and using a list to display the subtitles, the code is now more accessible and easier to understand for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
