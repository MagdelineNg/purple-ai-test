To improve the accessibility of this code, the <li> element should be contained within a <ul> or <ol> element. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:

<ul>
  <li class="some-class"><a href="/contact-us/" class="some-class">Contact Us</a><div class="some-class"></div></li>
</ul>

By wrapping the <li> element in a <ul> element, it's clear that this is a list item and it's easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the structure of the content. Additionally, the unnecessary escape characters have been removed from the href attribute of the <a> element.
