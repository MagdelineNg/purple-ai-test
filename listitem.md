To improve the accessibility of this code, we need to make sure that the list item element is contained within an ordered or unordered list element. Here's an example of how we can modify the code:

<ul>
  <li class="some-class">
    <a href="/contact-us/" class="some-class">Contact Us</a>
    <div class="some-class"></div>
  </li>
</ul>

By wrapping the list item element within a <ul> element, we ensure that it is semantically correct and accessible to all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.
