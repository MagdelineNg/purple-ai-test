  "label": "One example of a semantically correct and accessible form element is the \"label\" element. \n\nHere is an example of how it can be used:\n\n```\n<label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n<input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required>\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"label\" element is used to provide a text label for the \"email\" input field. The \"for\" attribute of the \"label\" element is set to the \"id\" attribute of the input field, which associates the label with the input field. This allows screen readers to read the label when the input field is focused on, making it more accessible for users with visual impairments. The \"required\" attribute is also used to indicate that the input field is required, which can help users who may have difficulty identifying required fields."
