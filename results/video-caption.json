  "video-caption": "One example of a video with the track element and other attributes to ensure accessibility is the TED Talk \"How to Speak So That People Want to Listen\" by Julian Treasure. The video includes closed captions, which can be turned on or off by the viewer, and a transcript is also available on the TED website. The video also includes audio descriptions for visual content, such as when Treasure shows a slide with text on it. Additionally, the video player includes controls for adjusting the playback speed and volume, and the video is embedded in a webpage with a clear and simple layout, making it easy to navigate and use with assistive technology."
