{"label-title-only":"1. Use the <label> element to associate a visible label with the form element. For example:\n\n<label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\">\n\n2. Use the aria-label attribute to provide a visible label for form elements that do not have a <label> element. For example:\n\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" aria-label=\"Submit form\">\n\n3. Use the title attribute to provide additional information about the form element, but do not rely on it as the sole means of labeling the element. For example:\n\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" title=\"Enter your email address\">\n\n4. Use the aria-describedby attribute to provide additional information about the form element, but do not rely on it as the sole means of labeling the element. For example:\n\n<label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n<input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" aria-describedby=\"password-help\">\n<div id=\"password-help\">Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</div>"}
