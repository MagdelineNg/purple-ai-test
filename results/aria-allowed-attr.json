Here it is again for reference:\n\n```<a class=\"some-class\" aria-label=\"some-label\"><i class=\"some-class\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> </a>``` \n\nThe ```aria-label``` attribute provides a text alternative for the icon inside the ```<a>``` element, while the ```aria-hidden``` attribute hides the icon from assistive technologies like screen readers."
