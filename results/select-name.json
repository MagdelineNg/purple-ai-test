{"select-name":"1. Add a label element: Instead of using the aria-labelledby attribute, add a label element with a for attribute that matches the id of the select element. This will associate the label with the select element and make it accessible to screen readers.\n\n2. Use meaningful option labels: Make sure the option labels are descriptive and meaningful. Avoid using vague or ambiguous labels like \"option 1\" or \"select\".\n\n3. Use the tabindex attribute: Add a tabindex attribute to the select element to make it keyboard accessible. Set the value to \"0\" to allow users to tab to the element.\n\n4. Provide feedback: Use ARIA attributes like aria-live and aria-atomic to provide feedback to users when the select element changes.\n\n5. Use contrasting colors: Make sure the select element and its options have sufficient contrast with the background color to make it visible to users with low vision.\n\n6. Test with a screen reader: Test the select element with a screen reader to ensure it is accessible and usable for all users."}
