  "link-name": "1. Use descriptive and unique link labels that accurately reflect the content of the linked page. For example, instead of using \"Read More\" for multiple links, use labels like \"Learn More\", \"View Details\", \"Explore\", etc.\n\n2. Use different variations of the same label. For example, instead of using \"Read More\" for every link, use \"Read More About [Topic]\", \"Read More on [Subject]\", \"Read More [Action]\", etc.\n\n3. Use icons or images to differentiate between links with similar labels. For example, use a magnifying glass icon for a \"View Details\" link and a book icon for a \"Learn More\" link.\n\n4. Use different font styles or colors to differentiate between links with similar labels. For example, use bold or italicized text for one link and regular text for another.\n\n5. Use contextual information to differentiate between links with similar labels. For example, if there are two \"Learn More\" links on a page, one could be placed next to a product image and the other next to a customer testimonial, making it clear which link relates to which content."
