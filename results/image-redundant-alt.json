  "image-redundant-alt": "Example 1:\n\nHTML code:\n```\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"A beautiful sunset\">\n<p>Here is a picture of a beautiful sunset:</p>\n```\nIn this example, the alternative text \"A beautiful sunset\" is repeated in the text. \n\nSolution:\n```\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"A beautiful sunset\">\n  <figcaption>A beautiful sunset</figcaption>\n</figure>\n```\nBy using the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements, we can provide a caption for the image that includes the alternative text. This way, the alternative text is not repeated in the text.\n\nExample 2:\n\nHTML code:\n```\n<img src=\"flower.jpg\" alt=\"A red rose\">\n<p>I received a beautiful bouquet of flowers today. One of the flowers was a red rose:</p>\n```\nIn this example, the alternative text \"A red rose\" is repeated in the text.\n\nSolution:\n```\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"flower.jpg\" alt=\"A red rose\">\n  <figcaption>A red rose from the bouquet I received today</figcaption>\n</figure>\n```\nAgain, by using the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements, we can provide a more descriptive caption for the image"
